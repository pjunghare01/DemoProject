package Polymorphism;     //Is Constructor overriding is Possible?  ---->No , it is not possible Because Constructor has a same name as a class name .
                                                    //And Overriding occurs when the same method is available in both super-class & sub-class with different statement .

public class Technology {
	public  technicalSkill() {   
		System.out.println("Coding");      
	}
	public  communicationSkill() {
		System.out.println("English");
	}

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		
	}

}



//con having a same as a class name but in con overriding it is not possible have same classes. thats why, in Constructor overriding is not possible here...
